### or, the HinderD network

In the State of California, Narcan is given to any corporation that requests it for life-saving purposes. The two kinds offered are intramuscular (injections) and nasal spray (over-the-counter Narcan). However, any individual who would like to carry Narcan to be helpful has no other option but to purchase it over-the-counter. HinderD would like to use this to build a network of volunteers (and for-proit organizations) who would like to receieve free narcan in case of emergencies. 

#### Volunteers

Volunteers can download the upcoming app to get notified of an emergency in their area. Bystanders who don't have sufficient training and do not request narcan can also download the app in case of emergency, to notify someone of the overdose. 

#### For-profit organizations

For-profit organizations that have narcan will be mapped in case of emergency; someone who doesn't have narcan can go to this location to retreve it if they are not close enough.

#### Already-registered non-profit organizations

Already-registered non-profit organizations can opt to be put on the map without ordering any narcan.
