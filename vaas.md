vaas stands for vocal analysis for abuse of substance. it is a neural net that lives on a chip, whose purpose is to listen to audio in common drug abuse locations (raves, street corners, parties, etc.) and detect patterns of overdose. if an overdose is detected, local law enforcement will be notified so that an overdose can be stopped in time.
